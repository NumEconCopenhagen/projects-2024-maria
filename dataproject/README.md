# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Dataproject: students ability to afford housing.** and is about students' ability to afford housing compared to the general population.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. dataX.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no other installations.
