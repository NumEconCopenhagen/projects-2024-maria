# Data analysis project

FYI: I've been sick the last week so I was allowed to hand in a few days latter (I expect I'll have it done by saturday evening), so my assignment won't be ready for peer feedback before then. So sorry for the inconvenience :)

Our project is titled **PROJECT TITLE** and is about EXPLAIN.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. dataX.csv (*source*) 
1. dataY.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
